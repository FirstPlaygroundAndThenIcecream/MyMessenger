# MyMessenger
It's a simple java chat program by using socket. It follows a simple protocol of itself, and able to have multiple clients, they can log in to the serve by follow the protocol, and are able to exchange messages. No GUI, and the time out method is not implemented right. Other than that, it works fine.
